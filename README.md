Novelty:

This game is played following some rules which makes it novel and more interesting for the players than standard games.
These rules are:
1) If any of the two dies contain 1, then the current score of the player will become 0 and the next player will roll the dies.
2) If any of the two dies does not contain 1, then the player can make two choices, either hold the current score or roll the dies again. If the player holds the current score, it will be added to the total score and the next player will roll the dies.
